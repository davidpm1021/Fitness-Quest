# Fitness Quest - Master Development Roadmap

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This is the ONLY roadmap document. Do not create additional roadmap files.**
- Update this document as you make progress
- Check off completed items with ‚úÖ
- Add new learnings and pivot decisions inline
- Cross out deprecated sections with ~~strikethrough~~
- Keep this as the single source of truth

---

**Current Status:** Deployed to Internal Testing Group
**Production URL:** https://fitness-quest-eosin.vercel.app/
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Core Engagement Loop
**Strategy:** Deep game mechanics first ‚Üí Visual polish later ‚Üí Iterate based on internal feedback

**Recent Progress (2025-01-18):**
- ‚úÖ Check-in UX overhaul: New modal-based flow with anticipation building (show d20 roll + AC, hide result until end)
- ‚úÖ Goal measurement types: Added armorClass to Monster interface for proper AC display
- ‚úÖ Fixed Prisma schema sync issues and removed deprecated flex_percentage field
- ‚úÖ Deployed multiple iterations to fix TypeScript compilation errors in production
- üöß Modal-based check-in flow in progress (replacing old single-page flow)

**Previous Milestones:**
- Phase 3.2 (Monster Phases) complete with dynamic monster difficulty system
- Phase 2 (Character Progression) complete with XP, leveling, focus points, and 3 skill trees
- Welcome-Back System complete
- Game balance simulation complete with recommendations pending review

---

## üéØ Development Philosophy

**Visual First, Mechanics Second:**
- Professional pixel art creates strong first impression
- Internal testers give ongoing feedback as we add features
- Deep game mechanics (leveling, skill trees, roguelite) keep long-term engagement
- Health first, game second - never incentivize harmful behaviors

**Build-Measure-Learn:**
- Ship features to internal group weekly
- Collect feedback continuously
- Iterate based on real usage data
- Don't build features users don't want

## ‚öñÔ∏è GAME BALANCE SIMULATION & TESTING (2025-10-15)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Simulation Verified - Balance Issues Identified
**Next Action:** üîî **REVIEW TOMORROW** - Consider balance adjustments and additional test scenarios

### üö® BALANCE FINDINGS - ACTION REQUIRED

**Simulation Run:** 60 days with Standard 4-Player Party (Perfect, Consistent, Consistent, Returning)

**Results:**
```
‚úÖ Simulation Complete!
- Party: Standard 4-Player Party
- Monsters Defeated: 29 in 60 days
- Average Days per Monster: 2.1 days (TARGET: 8-15 days)
- Player Levels: Average Level 6 (GOOD - target: 6-9)
- Average Damage per Check-in: 40.9
- Party Deaths: 0
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è BALANCE RED FLAGS:**

**[MEDIUM SEVERITY] Monsters Too Easy**
- **Metric:** Average 2.1 days per monster (target: 8-15 days)
- **Impact:** Combat feels trivial, progression too fast, no strategic tension
- **Root Cause:** Multiple attacks system (1 attack per goal met) + high damage values
- **Recommendation:** **Increase monster HP by 3x**
  - TANK: 300 HP ‚Üí 900 HP (or 600 HP for 2x)
  - BALANCED: 200 HP ‚Üí 600 HP (or 400 HP for 2x)
  - GLASS_CANNON: 150 HP ‚Üí 450 HP (or 300 HP for 2x)

**Combat Analysis:**
- Average 41 damage per check-in (with 4 players)
- Action usage: 67% ATTACK, 14% DEFEND, 6% SUPPORT, 13% HEROIC_STRIKE
- Players have high damage output with multiple attacks
- Current monster HP pools are depleted in 2-3 days with consistent team

### üìã TOMORROW'S ACTION ITEMS

**üîî REMINDER: Review These Decisions Tomorrow**

**1. Balance Adjustment Decision:**
- [ ] Review simulation results with fresh perspective
- [ ] Decide on monster HP multiplier (2x, 3x, or custom per type)
- [ ] Consider if multiple attacks system needs adjustment
- [ ] Evaluate if leveling speed is satisfactory (level 6 after 60 days = good)

**2. Potential Additional Tests:**
- [ ] Solo player simulation (how does single-player experience feel?)
- [ ] Large 8-player party simulation (does damage scale too high?)
- [ ] Burnout/Casual-heavy party (what's minimum viable engagement?)
- [ ] Different monster sequences (TANK ‚Üí BALANCED ‚Üí GLASS_CANNON progression)
- [ ] Skill tree impact simulation (what if players invest in damage skills?)
- [ ] Welcome-back system testing (does the 3-day absence bonus work correctly?)

**3. Implement Changes (if approved):**
- [ ] Update monster stats in `tests/simulation/game-simulation.ts`
- [ ] Re-run simulation with new values
- [ ] Verify 8-15 day target is met
- [ ] Update `prisma/seed-monsters.ts` with production values
- [ ] Deploy to production if satisfied

## üêõ KNOWN BUGS & UI IMPROVEMENTS

### Bug #4: Goals Deletion Uses Browser Popup (PENDING)
**Severity:** LOW - UI consistency issue
**Location:** `/goals` page - goal deletion
**Status:** üêõ OPEN - Needs fixing

**Symptoms:**
- Clicking "Delete" on a goal shows browser's native confirm() popup
- Other parts of the app use custom pixel art styled modals (PixelPanel)
- Breaks visual consistency and doesn't match game aesthetic

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should use custom PixelPanel modal with pixel art styled buttons
- Match the visual style of other confirmation dialogs in the app

**Impact:**
- Low priority - functional but not polished
- Affects user experience during goal management
- Inconsistent with app's retro game aesthetic

**Fix Required:**
- Replace `window.confirm()` with custom PixelPanel confirmation modal
- Add "Are you sure?" message with CONFIRM/CANCEL pixel buttons
- Maintain same deletion functionality with better UX

**Files to Update:**
- `app/goals/page.tsx` - Replace confirm() call with custom modal

---

## ~~üé® PHASE 0.5: Visual Polish~~ (DEPRECATED)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPRECATED** - See Phase 8 for complete character/animation overhaul
**New Approach:** Complete technical rebuild with PixiJS + Aseprite sprite sheets (Phase 8)
**Priority:** LOW - Current procedural system adequate for internal testing

**‚ö†Ô∏è This phase is deprecated in favor of Phase 8's comprehensive overhaul.** The current procedural Canvas 2D system is functional for beta testing but will be completely replaced with a production-ready PixiJS-based architecture. All custom sprite creation tasks below are on hold pending the Phase 8 implementation.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **May be unnecessary** - Fitness tracker APIs (Priority 1) provide automatic verification without manual effort

**Design Decisions Needed (if proceeding):**
1. Bonus type: Momentum (+2), Focus (+1), or Defense (+3)?
2. Scope: One proof per check-in or per goal?
3. Sharing: Include party visibility in MVP?
4. Retention: 30-day auto-delete or keep longer?

### Success Metrics

- [ ] Auto-sync reduces check-in time to <30 seconds
- [ ] Proof uploads (if implemented) used by 20%+ of check-ins
- [ ] Verification features don't create friction or shame

---

## üèóÔ∏è PHASE 8: Character & Animation System Overhaul

**Goal:** Complete technical overhaul of character rendering, animations, and related systems
**Timeline:** 8-10 weeks (4 sub-phases)
**Priority:** HIGH - Required before public launch
**Status:** üöß **SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT TRACK** - Build in isolation, deploy when complete

---

### üö® CRITICAL: SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT TRACK üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS OVERHAUL WILL BE BUILT ENTIRELY SEPARATELY FROM THE MAIN APPLICATION**

**Build Location:** `/app/character-system-v2/` (or similar isolated directory)
**Integration:** Only after complete implementation, testing, and approval
**Production Impact:** **ZERO** until explicitly deployed
**Current System:** Beta testers continue using existing procedural Canvas system unaffected

**Why Separate:**
- Beta testers rely on current system daily - cannot disrupt their experience
- Major architectural changes require extended development and testing
- Allows parallel development of gameplay features (Phase 1-7) while building new foundation
- Prevents half-finished system from affecting production stability
- Enables thorough testing before cutover

**Development Approach:**
1. Build new character/animation system in isolated components
2. Create dedicated test pages (e.g., `/character-system-v2/test`)
3. Do NOT import or link from main application pages
4. Only integrate after Phase 8.4 is 100% complete and approved
5. Plan cutover migration strategy before deployment

---

### üìã Executive Summary

**Current State:** Procedural Canvas 2D rendering with runtime transforms
**Target State:** PixiJS WebGL rendering with Aseprite sprite sheets and hybrid asset pipeline

**Core Changes:**
1. **Rendering:** Canvas 2D ‚Üí PixiJS (WebGL-accelerated, sprite batching)
2. **Art Pipeline:** Procedural-only ‚Üí Hybrid (sprite sheets + procedural fallback)
3. **Workflow:** Code-based ‚Üí Aseprite with tagged animations + JSON export
4. **Database:** Single character ‚Üí Multiple characters with inventory system
5. **Auth:** JWT ‚Üí Cookie-based sessions with argon2id
6. **State:** Props drilling ‚Üí Zustand
7. **Testing:** Manual QA ‚Üí Automated unit + visual regression tests

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Will Bite Later (Technical Debt)

**1. Procedural-Only Art**
- **Problem:** Inconsistent alignment across frames, outfits, animations. Rotating pixel swords causes jaggies and shimmer. Difficult for pixel artists to collaborate.
- **Impact:** Visual quality ceiling, hard to iterate, can't work with external artists

**2. Two Rendering Paths (24√ó24 and 64√ó64)**
- **Problem:** Maintaining two systems with different proportions and frame logic causes drift
- **Impact:** Double maintenance burden, inconsistent visual style

**3. Canvas 2D for Everything**
- **Problem:** Once you add party vs monster, layered cosmetics, particles, floating damage, screen shake in one scene, Canvas 2D stutters on laptops and phones
- **Impact:** Performance issues at scale, no sprite batching or texture atlases

**4. Animation Transforms in Code**
- **Problem:** Frame-time rotations and translations for pixel elements look blurry unless you pre-bake frames or snap to device pixels. Causes "swimming" pixels.
- **Impact:** Visual quality suffers, hard to debug

**5. Single Character Per User**
- **Problem:** `user_id: unique` in `character_appearances` blocks multiple characters, alts, test dummies, or NPCs
- **Impact:** Can't support character slots, limits future features

**6. Cosmetic Unlock Rules in Client Code**
- **Problem:** Not server-authoritative, vulnerable to cheating
- **Impact:** Exploitable unlock system

**7. JWT with Manual bcryptjs**
- **Problem:** Easy to misconfigure. Long JWT lifetimes, CSRF vulnerabilities, weak password hashing
- **Impact:** Security risks, token management complexity

**8. No State Management Library**
- **Problem:** Props drilling getting messy as app grows
- **Impact:** Hard to maintain, difficult to debug state issues

### Priority 1: Rendering Engine & Art Pipeline (8-12 days)

**Goal:** Professional 2D rendering with artist-friendly workflow

#### 1. Adopt PixiJS for 2D Rendering (3-4 days)

**Why PixiJS:**
- WebGL-accelerated sprite batching
- Texture atlas support (reduce HTTP requests)
- Built-in nearest-neighbor filtering for pixel art
- Handles layered sprites efficiently
- Industry standard for 2D web games

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Example PixiJS setup
import { Application, Sprite, Texture } from 'pixi.js';

const app = new Application({
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
  antialias: false,
  resolution: window.devicePixelRatio,
  autoDensity: true,
});

// Enable nearest-neighbor for crisp pixels
app.renderer.roundPixels = true;
PIXI.settings.SCALE_MODE = PIXI.SCALE_MODES.NEAREST;
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install PixiJS + React integration (`npm install pixi.js @pixi/react`)
- [ ] Create `<PixiStage>` wrapper component for React integration
- [ ] Create PixiJS character sprite component (replace Canvas component)
- [ ] Implement texture loading and sprite sheet parsing
- [ ] Add animation controller (frame-based, not transform-based)
- [ ] Turn on: `roundPixels`, `resolution = devicePixelRatio`, `SCALE_MODE = NEAREST`
- [ ] Test performance with 8+ characters on screen
- [ ] Fallback to Canvas for browsers without WebGL support

---

#### 2. Standardize Art Format & Pipeline (2-3 days)

**Canonical Frame Size:** 32√ó32 pixels (or 48√ó48 for higher detail)
**Source of Truth:** Aseprite files with tagged animations
**Export:** PNG sprite sheets + JSON metadata

**Sprite Metadata Schema:**
```typescript
type AnimKey = "idle"|"walk"|"attack"|"hit"|"victory"|"defend"|"support"|"heroic_strike";

interface SpriteMeta {
  frameWidth: number;           // 32 or 48
  frameHeight: number;          // 32 or 48
  columns: number;              // Frames per row
  rows: number;                 // Number of rows
  animations: Record<AnimKey, number[]>;  // Frame indices for each animation
  anchors?: { x: number, y: number };    // 0..1, sprite origin point
  layers?: string[];            // ["base","hair","hat","shirt","pants","weapon"]
  offsets?: Record<string, {x:number, y:number}[]>; // Per-layer per-frame pixel offsets
  version: string;              // Asset version pin (e.g., "1.0.0")
}
```

**Example Metadata:**
```json
{
  "frameWidth": 32,
  "frameHeight": 32,
  "columns": 8,
  "rows": 4,
  "animations": {
    "idle": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "walk": [8, 9, 10, 11],
    "attack": [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21],
    "hit": [24, 25, 26, 27]
  },
  "anchors": { "x": 0.5, "y": 0.9 },
  "layers": ["base", "hair", "outfit", "weapon"],
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

**Workflow:**
1. Artist creates/edits `.ase` file in Aseprite
2. Tag animations (idle, walk, attack, etc.)
3. Export script generates PNG sprite sheet + JSON metadata
4. CI validates sprite sheet dimensions and frame counts
5. Deploy to `/public/sprites/` with version number in filename

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Adopt Aseprite as official tool (.ase/.aseprite source format)
- [ ] Create art style guide (color palette, dimensions, frame timing)
- [ ] Set up export scripts (Aseprite ‚Üí PNG sprite sheets + JSON)
- [ ] Document sprite sheet format and metadata schema
- [ ] Create `/art-src` directory for source files in version control
- [ ] Build process integration (auto-export on build)
- [ ] **Pre-bake rotations:** Draw weapon rotations in sprite sheet, not runtime

---

#### 3. Replace Procedural-Only with Hybrid Assets (3-5 days)

**Goal:** Layerable PNG sprite sheets with procedural fallback

**Asset Structure:**
```
/public/sprites/
  /characters/
    /base/
      body-32x32.png          # Base character body
      body-32x32.json         # Metadata
    /hair/
      short-32x32.png         # Layered hair sprite
      short-32x32.json
    /outfits/
      knight-32x32.png        # Layered outfit
      knight-32x32.json
    /weapons/
      sword-32x32.png         # Layered weapon
      sword-32x32.json
```

**Palette Swapping:**
```typescript
// Color map for palette swaps
interface ColorMap {
  from: string;  // Original hex color
  to: string;    // Replacement hex color
}

// Example: Recolor skin tone
const skinToneMap: ColorMap[] = [
  { from: '#fbbf24', to: '#d97706' },  // Light ‚Üí Medium
  { from: '#f59e0b', to: '#b45309' },
];
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Commission or create 1 reference character sprite (all animation states)
- [ ] Build color palette swap system (work with real sprites, not procedural)
- [ ] Keep procedural generation as fallback for missing assets
- [ ] Create modular layer system (base body, outfit, hair, accessories, weapon)
- [ ] Test customization with real sprite layers
- [ ] Document layer naming conventions
- [ ] Add pixel-level visual tests using `pixelmatch` in CI

**Why This Matters:**
- Professional visuals = higher retention
- Artist-friendly workflow = faster iteration
- PixiJS = better performance at scale (WebGL rendering)
- Sprite sheets easier to debug than procedural code

---

### Priority 2: Database & Reward System (5-7 days)

**Goal:** Server-authoritative rewards and flexible character system

#### 1. Fix Database Model for Multiple Characters (2-3 days)

**New Database Schema:**
```prisma
model users {
  id         String      @id
  email      String      @unique
  // Remove character_name, onboarding_step - move to characters table
  characters Character[]
  created_at DateTime    @default(now())
}

model characters {
  id                 String    @id
  user_id            String
  character_name     String
  appearance_id      String?
  level              Int       @default(1)
  xp                 Int       @default(0)
  created_at         DateTime  @default(now())
  users              users     @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [id])
  party_members      PartyMember[]
  cosmetic_inventory CosmeticInventory[]

  @@index([user_id])
}

model cosmetic_inventory {
  id               String    @id
  character_id     String    // Changed from user_id
  cosmetic_item_id String
  equipped         Boolean   @default(false)  // NEW: Track if currently wearing
  acquired_at      DateTime  @default(now())  // NEW: When unlocked
  characters       characters @relation(fields: [character_id], references: [id])
  cosmetic_items   cosmetic_items @relation(fields: [cosmetic_item_id], references: [id])

  @@unique([character_id, cosmetic_item_id])
}
```

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Create `characters` table
2. Migrate existing `users.character_name` ‚Üí `characters.character_name`
3. Create character record for each existing user
4. Update `party_members.user_id` ‚Üí `party_members.character_id`
5. Rename `user_cosmetic_unlocks` ‚Üí `cosmetic_inventory`
6. Add `equipped` and `acquired_at` columns

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `characters` table to Prisma schema
- [ ] Add `character_id` foreign key to `party_members`
- [ ] Create migration to move character data from users table
- [ ] Update onboarding flow to create character record
- [ ] Allow users to create multiple characters (UI in Phase 9+)
- [ ] Update all queries to join through characters table

---

#### 2. Cosmetics as Inventory System (2-3 days)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Rename `user_cosmetic_unlocks` ‚Üí `cosmetic_inventory`
- [ ] Add `equipped` boolean flag (unlock vs. currently wearing)
- [ ] Add `acquired_at` timestamp (track when unlocked)
- [ ] Add `asset_version` to cosmetic_items (track sprite version)
- [ ] Add `procedural_seed` to cosmetic_items (deterministic procedural fallback)
- [ ] Update API to return separate unlocked/equipped lists
- [ ] Add equip/unequip endpoints (`/api/cosmetics/equip`)
- [ ] Update character customization UI to show inventory

---

#### 3. Make Server Authoritative for Rewards (1-2 days)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Server-side unlock logic
// app/api/cosmetics/check-unlocks/route.ts

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { characterId } = await request.json();

  // Get character stats
  const character = await prisma.characters.findUnique({
    where: { id: characterId },
    include: { party_members: true },
  });

  // Check unlock conditions
  const newUnlocks = [];
  const allCosmetics = await prisma.cosmetic_items.findMany();

  for (const cosmetic of allCosmetics) {
    // Check if already unlocked
    const existing = await prisma.cosmetic_inventory.findUnique({
      where: {
        character_id_cosmetic_item_id: {
          character_id: characterId,
          cosmetic_item_id: cosmetic.id,
        },
      },
    });

    if (existing) continue;

    // Check unlock condition
    const unlocked = checkUnlockCondition(character, cosmetic);

    if (unlocked) {
      await prisma.cosmetic_inventory.create({
        data: {
          id: crypto.randomUUID(),
          character_id: characterId,
          cosmetic_item_id: cosmetic.id,
          equipped: false,
          acquired_at: new Date(),
        },
      });

      newUnlocks.push(cosmetic);
    }
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ success: true, newUnlocks });
}
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Move cosmetic unlock logic to server (`/api/cosmetics/check-unlocks`)
- [ ] Run unlock checks after every check-in, level-up, and monster defeat
- [ ] Return newly unlocked items in API responses
- [ ] Show unlock celebration UI on client (after server confirms)
- [ ] Add audit log for unlock events (prevent cheating)
- [ ] Remove client-side unlock logic
- [ ] Add streak logic with grace windows (1 missed day doesn't break streak)
- [ ] Add anti-cheat checks (server validates streak based on timestamps)

**Why This Matters:**
- Multiple characters = more customization, more engagement
- Inventory system = clearer UX (what I have vs. what I'm wearing)
- Server authority = prevent cheating, ensure fairness
- Future-proof for trading/gifting (Phase 9+)

---

### Priority 3: Auth & Security (3-4 days)

**Goal:** Production-grade authentication and security

#### 1. Migrate to Cookie-Based Sessions (2-3 days)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Use iron-session or next-auth
import { withIronSessionApiRoute } from 'iron-session/next';

export const sessionOptions = {
  password: process.env.SESSION_SECRET as string,
  cookieName: 'fitness_quest_session',
  cookieOptions: {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    sameSite: 'lax' as const,
    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days
  },
};

// Middleware for API routes
export function withSession(handler: any) {
  return withIronSessionApiRoute(handler, sessionOptions);
}
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install `iron-session` or `next-auth` (cookie-based session management)
- [ ] Create session middleware for API routes
- [ ] Replace JWT token passing with httpOnly cookies
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Implement session refresh (no manual token refresh)
- [ ] Update all client-side auth checks
- [ ] Test session expiration and renewal

---

#### 2. Upgrade Password Hashing (1 day)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
import argon2 from '@node-rs/argon2';

// Hash password on registration
const hashedPassword = await argon2.hash(password);

// Verify password on login
const valid = await argon2.verify(storedHash, password);
```

**Add Zod Validation:**
```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const loginSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(12),
});

// In API route
const { email, password } = loginSchema.parse(await request.json());
```

**Add Rate Limiting:**
```typescript
// Simple rate limiter with Upstash Redis or in-memory Map
const rateLimiter = new Map<string, number[]>();

function checkRateLimit(ip: string, maxRequests: number, windowMs: number): boolean {
  const now = Date.now();
  const requests = rateLimiter.get(ip) || [];
  const recentRequests = requests.filter(time => now - time < windowMs);

  if (recentRequests.length >= maxRequests) {
    return false; // Rate limit exceeded
  }

  recentRequests.push(now);
  rateLimiter.set(ip, recentRequests);
  return true;
}
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install `@node-rs/argon2` (faster, more secure than bcryptjs)
- [ ] Migrate password verification to use both (check bcrypt first, upgrade on next login)
- [ ] Update registration to use argon2id
- [ ] Add password strength requirements (min 12 chars, complexity check)
- [ ] Add rate limiting on login endpoint (prevent brute force)
- [ ] Install and configure Zod for schema validation

**Why This Matters:**
- Cookies = simpler auth flow, less client-side token management
- Argon2id = industry standard (2023 OWASP recommendation)
- Session management = better UX (auto-refresh, no expired tokens)
- Rate limiting = prevent brute force attacks

---

### Priority 4: Performance & UX Guardrails (4-6 days)

**Goal:** Smooth performance at scale with 50+ concurrent users

#### 1. Offload Heavy Work to Web Workers (2-3 days)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Identify CPU-heavy tasks (sprite generation, large data processing)
- [ ] Create Web Worker for procedural sprite generation
- [ ] Move combat calculations to worker (if complex)
- [ ] Add worker pool management (reuse workers)
- [ ] Test with slow devices (throttled CPU)
- [ ] Add loading states while worker runs

---

#### 2. Texture Atlases & Asset Optimization (2-3 days)

**Use Texture Atlases:**
```typescript
// Combine multiple sprite sheets into one atlas
// Use TexturePacker or similar tool
{
  "frames": {
    "character-idle-0": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 32, "h": 32 },
    "character-idle-1": { "x": 32, "y": 0, "w": 32, "h": 32 },
    "monster-attack-0": { "x": 64, "y": 0, "w": 64, "h": 64 },
  },
  "meta": {
    "image": "atlas.png",
    "size": { "w": 512, "h": 512 }
  }
}
```

**Snap Positions to Integer Pixels:**
```typescript
sprite.position.x = Math.round(sprite.position.x);
sprite.position.y = Math.round(sprite.position.y);
```

**Memoize Composition:**
```typescript
const cacheKey = `${metaVersion}_${baseId}_${cosmeticIds.join(',')}_${paletteMap}_${animKey}_${frameIndex}`;
const cached = spriteCache.get(cacheKey);
if (cached) return cached;
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Combine sprite sheets into texture atlases (reduce HTTP requests)
- [ ] Use image sprites for UI elements (buttons, icons)
- [ ] Implement progressive image loading (low-res placeholder ‚Üí high-res)
- [ ] Add WebP format with PNG fallback
- [ ] Set up CDN caching headers (1 year for sprites)
- [ ] Lazy load non-critical images
- [ ] Preload assets on route hover
- [ ] Add low-end mode (reduce particles, shorter combat sequences)

**Why This Matters:**
- Web Workers = responsive UI even with heavy processing
- Texture atlases = fewer network requests, faster load times
- Progressive loading = perceived performance improvement
- Mobile users on slow connections need optimized assets

---

### Priority 5: State Management & Testing (5-7 days)

**Goal:** Maintainable codebase with automated testing

#### 1. Add Zustand for State Management (2-3 days)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// store/gameStore.ts

  maxHp: number;
  level: number;
  xp: number;
  focusPoints: number;
  setHp: (hp: number) => void;
  takeDamage: (damage: number) => void;
}

export const useGameStore = create<GameState>((set) => ({
  currentHp: 100,
  maxHp: 100,
  level: 1,
  xp: 0,
  focusPoints: 5,
  setHp: (hp) => set({ currentHp: hp }),
  takeDamage: (damage) => set((state) => ({ currentHp: Math.max(0, state.currentHp - damage) })),
}));
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install `zustand` (lightweight React state management)
- [ ] Create stores for user, party, goals, character appearance
- [ ] Replace props drilling with store hooks
- [ ] Add persistence layer (sync store with localStorage)
- [ ] Test state updates across components
- [ ] Document store usage patterns

---

#### 2. Add Unit Tests for Core Logic (2-3 days)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// __tests__/unlocks.test.ts
import { checkUnlockCondition } from '@/lib/unlocks';

test('unlocks knight outfit at level 5', () => {
  const character = { level: 5, streak: 10 };
  const cosmetic = { unlock_condition_type: 'LEVEL', unlock_threshold: 5 };

  expect(checkUnlockCondition(character, cosmetic)).toBe(true);
});
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install Vitest (fast unit test runner)
- [ ] Write tests for combat calculations (`lib/combat.ts`)
- [ ] Write tests for XP/leveling logic
- [ ] Write tests for skill tree validation
- [ ] Write tests for goal completion checks
- [ ] Aim for 80%+ coverage on core game logic

---

#### 3. Visual Regression Tests (1-2 days)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Example visual regression test
import pixelmatch from 'pixelmatch';
import { PNG } from 'pngjs';

test('sprite frames match reference', () => {
  const reference = PNG.sync.read(fs.readFileSync('sprites/reference/hero-idle.png'));
  const current = PNG.sync.read(fs.readFileSync('public/sprites/characters/hero-idle.png'));

  const diff = new PNG({ width: reference.width, height: reference.height });
  const numDiffPixels = pixelmatch(
    reference.data,
    current.data,
    diff.data,
    reference.width,
    reference.height,
    { threshold: 0.1 }
  );

  expect(numDiffPixels).toBeLessThan(10); // Allow minor anti-aliasing differences
});
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up Playwright visual testing
- [ ] Capture screenshots of key pages (check-in, dashboard, skills)
- [ ] Add visual diff checks to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Test responsive layouts (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Add pixel-level sprite comparison with `pixelmatch`

**Why This Matters:**
- Zustand = cleaner code, easier debugging, better performance
- Unit tests = catch regressions early, refactor with confidence
- Visual tests = prevent UI bugs, ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Automated testing = ship faster with fewer bugs

---

### Priority 6: Developer Workflow & Asset Management (2-3 days)

**Goal:** Efficient asset creation and version control

#### 1. Aseprite Source Files in Git (1 day)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `/art-src` directory in repo
- [ ] Add `.ase` source files with layers intact
- [ ] Add `.gitattributes` for Git LFS (large binary files)
- [ ] Document naming conventions (`character-idle-knight.ase`)
- [ ] Add README with export instructions

---

#### 2. Asset Versioning & Changelog (1 day)

**Asset Manifest JSON:**
```json
{
  "characters": {
    "base-body": {
      "version": "1.2.0",
      "path": "/sprites/characters/base-body-v1.2.0.png",
      "metadata": "/sprites/characters/base-body-v1.2.0.json"
    }
  }
}
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `/public/sprites/CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] Track sprite updates (version, date, changes)
- [ ] Add sprite manifest JSON (list all sprites with metadata)
- [ ] Implement cache busting (version number in filename)
- [ ] Document when to increment sprite versions

---

#### 3. Build-Time Asset Validation (1 day)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// scripts/validate-sprites.ts
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

const requiredSprites = ['character-idle', 'character-walk', 'monster-attack'];

for (const sprite of requiredSprites) {
  const pngPath = path.join('public/sprites', `${sprite}.png`);
  const jsonPath = path.join('public/sprites', `${sprite}.json`);

  if (!fs.existsSync(pngPath)) {
    throw new Error(`Missing sprite: ${sprite}.png`);
  }
  if (!fs.existsSync(jsonPath)) {
    throw new Error(`Missing metadata: ${sprite}.json`);
  }
}

console.log('‚úÖ All required sprites present');
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Script to verify all required sprites exist
- [ ] Validate sprite dimensions and frame counts
- [ ] Check for missing animations (idle, attack, etc.)
- [ ] Warn if sprites are too large (>50KB)
- [ ] Run validation in CI/CD pipeline

**Why This Matters:**
- Source files in Git = easier collaboration, full history
- Asset versioning = cache invalidation, rollback capability
- Build validation = catch missing sprites before deployment
- Consistent workflow = faster onboarding for artists/contributors

---

---

### What to Keep, What to Drop

**Keep:**
- ‚úÖ Next.js + TypeScript + Prisma + PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ Tailwind and component library
- ‚úÖ Animation states already defined
- ‚úÖ Confetti and Recharts for player feedback

**Drop or Change:**
- ‚ùå Two character renderers ‚Üí Pick one canonical scale (32√ó32)
- ‚ùå Runtime rotation for pixel art ‚Üí Pre-bake into frames
- ‚ùå Procedural-only sprites ‚Üí Hybrid pipeline (real sheets + procedural fallback)
- ‚ùå JWT-only auth ‚Üí Cookie sessions + argon2id
- ‚ùå No state management ‚Üí Add Zustand
- ‚ùå Manual QA only ‚Üí Add automated tests

---

### When to Tackle This Phase

**Build if:**
- ‚úÖ Internal testing reveals performance issues
- ‚úÖ Adding features becomes painful (props drilling, state bugs)
- ‚úÖ Planning to scale beyond 50 users
- ‚úÖ Security audit identifies auth weaknesses
- ‚úÖ Artists struggle with current workflow
- ‚úÖ Preparing for public launch

**Defer if:**
- ‚ùå Core gameplay loop not validated yet
- ‚ùå User feedback requests different features
- ‚ùå Team size <2 (too much infrastructure work)
- ‚ùå No pain points identified in current architecture

**Current Recommendation:** Start Phase 8.1 (Foundations) after Phase 1 Combat Engagement is complete and validated with internal testers. Build entire Phase 8 in isolation before integrating into production.

## üö´ What We're NOT Building (Yet)

### Explicitly Out of Scope Until Proven Success:
- ‚ùå Mobile native apps (PWA first, native in Phase 8+)
- ‚ùå Fitness tracker integrations (manual entry for now, **designed in Phase 7**)
- ‚ùå Proof upload system (manual entry only, **designed in Phase 7 - nice to have**)
- ‚ùå Multiple parties per user (one party focus)
- ‚ùå Full party chat system (just encouragements and reactions)
- ‚ùå Competitive leaderboards (avoid negative comparison)
- ‚ùå Monetization (free during internal/beta testing)
- ‚ùå Multi-language support (English only for now)
- ‚ùå Custom domains (Vercel subdomain is fine)

### Build These Only If Internal Users Request:
- Public parties / party discovery
- Friend system beyond party
- Trading/marketplace for cosmetics
- PvP party battles
- Custom monster creation by users
- Advanced admin dashboard
- White-label solutions

---

## üéØ Feature Prioritization Framework

When deciding what to build next, use this scoring system:

### Impact Score (1-10)
- Will it increase check-in rate?
- Will it improve retention?
- Does it solve a common user complaint?
- Is it a frequently requested feature?

### Effort Score (1-10)
- How many days to implement?
- Does it require new infrastructure?
- How complex is the testing?
- What's the risk of bugs?

### Priority = Impact / Effort

**Build first:** High impact, low effort (score >2)
**Build soon:** High impact, high effort (score 1-2)
**Build maybe:** Low impact, low effort (score 0.5-1)
**Don't build:** Low impact, high effort (score <0.5)

---

## üí° Design Principles

### 1. Game Feel Over Features
Better to have 4 combat actions that feel amazing than 10 that feel flat.

### 2. Strategic Depth Through Simplicity
Focus points, skill trees, and modifiers add depth without overwhelming complexity.

### 3. Roguelite Loop, Not Grind
Each monster is a "run" with unique challenges. Meta-progression makes future runs easier.

### 4. Positive-Only Social
Encouragements and healing, never comparison or shaming.

### 5. Respect Time
Core loop stays <2 minutes. Everything else is optional engagement.

### 6. Health First, Game Second
Never incentivize overtraining, under-eating, or harmful behaviors. Rest days are healthy.

---

## üîÑ Build-Measure-Learn Loop

For every new feature:

### 1. Build (1-3 days)
- Implement simplest version that works
- Don't over-engineer
- Ship to internal group fast

### 2. Measure (3-7 days)
- Track specific metrics
- Collect qualitative feedback
- Watch actual usage (not what users say)

### 3. Learn (1 day)
- Did it work? (Check metrics)
- Why or why not? (Analyze behavior)
- What's next? (Decide: iterate, remove, or keep)

### 4. Decide
- **Keep:** Feature is used, metrics improved ‚Üí Leave it
- **Iterate:** Feature is used, but needs work ‚Üí Improve it
- **Remove:** Feature isn't used ‚Üí Delete it
- **Pivot:** Insight suggests different approach ‚Üí Update roadmap

---

## üéÆ Inspiration & References

**Game Feel:**
- **Slay the Spire:** Roguelite run structure, meta-progression
- **Hades:** Combat feel, character progression
- **Stardew Valley:** Pixel art aesthetic, daily loop

**Mechanics:**
- **D&D 5e:** Combat basics (d20, AC, HP)
- **Roguelites:** Battle modifiers, permanent upgrades
- **Idle/Clicker Games:** Numbers go up satisfaction

**Social:**
- **Habitica:** Fitness gamification (but we're more engaging)
- **Pok√©mon GO:** Community days, events, social accountability

## üìù Sprint Planning Template

When creating sprints from this roadmap:

1. **Follow phase order** - Don't jump ahead
2. **One phase at a time** - Complete before moving on
3. **Measure before moving** - Check metrics after each sprint
4. **Internal feedback drives priority** - Roadmap is flexible
5. **Keep sprints small** - 1-2 weeks max per sprint

**Template:**
```
Sprint X: [Name] (Week Y)
Goal: [One sentence]
Tasks: [Bullet list from phase]
Success Criteria: [Measurable outcomes]
Timeline: [Days]
```

## üß™ END-TO-END TEST REPORT (2025-10-14)

**Test Date:** October 14, 2025
**Test Method:** Automated browser testing via Playwright
**Test Coverage:** Complete user journey from registration through check-in
**Test User:** test@fitnessquest.com / "Testing Hero"

### Test Summary

**‚úÖ WORKING FEATURES:**
- Landing page and navigation
- User registration flow with email validation
- Character creation with outfit customization
- Goal setting (Cardio - 30 minutes)
- Party creation ("Test Warriors")
- Monster selection (15 monsters displaying correctly)
- Check-in page UI and action selection

**üêõ CRITICAL BUGS FOUND:**

### Bug #1: Party API Validation Error ‚úÖ FIXED (2025-10-14)
**Severity:** HIGH - Blocks core party functionality
**Location:** `app/api/parties/my-party/route.ts:32`
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard shows "No party joined yet" even though party was successfully created
- Party page redirects to setup screen after successful party creation
- Console shows 500 Internal Server Error on `/api/parties/my-party`

**Root Cause:**
```
Error fetching user's party: Error [PrismaClientValidationError]:
Invalid `prisma.party_members.findFirst()` invocation:
Unknown field `xp` for select statement on model `party_members`
```

The API at `route.ts:63-64` selects fields `xp` and `level`:
```typescript
focus_points: true,
xp: true,           // ‚Üê Prisma client doesn't recognize this field
level: true,        // ‚Üê Prisma client doesn't recognize this field
```

**Analysis:**
These fields exist in the Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma:176-178`) and were added via migration `20251014160000_add_skill_trees_and_skill_points`, but the Prisma client hasn't been regenerated after the migration.

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
npx prisma generate  # Regenerated Prisma client
```

**Resolution:**
Prisma client successfully regenerated to recognize the new `xp`, `level`, and `skill_points` fields that were added in migration `20251014160000_add_skill_trees_and_skill_points`.

**Files Affected:**
- `app/api/parties/my-party/route.ts`
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (depends on party API)
- `app/party/page.tsx` (depends on party API)

---

### Bug #2: Skills Page Blank Screen ‚úÖ FIXED (2025-10-14)
**Severity:** MEDIUM - New feature non-functional
**Location:** `/skills` page
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Symptoms:**
- Navigating to `/skills` shows completely blank white screen
- Console shows 500 Internal Server Error
- No error message displayed to user

**Root Cause:**
Same as Bug #1 - the skills API queries `party_members.xp` and `party_members.level` fields that Prisma client didn't recognize before regeneration.

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
npx prisma generate  # Regenerated Prisma client
```

**Resolution:**
Skills page API now successfully queries user's XP, level, and skill points from the `party_members` table.

---

### Bug #3: Check-in Target Value Not Displaying ‚úÖ FIXED (2025-10-14)
**Severity:** LOW - UI polish issue
**Location:** `/check-in` page
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Symptoms:**
- Goal card shows "Target: (¬±%)"
- Should show "Target: 30 minutes ¬±10%"
- Actual value input field works correctly

**Expected Display:**
```
Cardio
Target: 30 minutes ¬±10%
```

**Actual Display:**
```
Cardio
Target: (¬±%)
```

**Root Cause:**
The goals API (`app/api/goals/route.ts`) was returning raw database results with snake_case field names (`target_value`, `target_unit`, `flex_percentage`), but the frontend expects camelCase (`targetValue`, `targetUnit`, `flexPercentage`).

**Fix Applied:**
Added field mapping in the goals API GET and POST endpoints to convert snake_case DB fields to camelCase:

```typescript
const mappedGoals = goals.map((goal) => ({
  id: goal.id,
  name: goal.name,
  goalType: goal.goal_type,
  targetValue: goal.target_value,        // ‚úÖ Mapped
  targetUnit: goal.target_unit,          // ‚úÖ Mapped
  flexPercentage: goal.flex_percentage,  // ‚úÖ Mapped
  isActive: goal.is_active,
  createdAt: goal.created_at,
  updatedAt: goal.updated_at,
}));
```

**Resolution:**
Check-in page now correctly displays goal target values: "Target: 30 minutes ¬±10%"

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/goals/route.ts` (lines 32-48, 119-130)

### Database State After Test

**Created Successfully:**
- ‚úÖ User account: test@fitnessquest.com
- ‚úÖ Character: "Testing Hero" with KNIGHT outfit
- ‚úÖ Character appearance record in database
- ‚úÖ Goal: Cardio - 30 minutes ¬±10%
- ‚úÖ Party: "Test Warriors" with invite code
- ‚úÖ Party membership for test user
- ‚úÖ Monster: "The Couch Potato Golem" selected as active monster

**Query Evidence from Logs:**
```sql
-- Party creation succeeded
INSERT INTO "public"."parties" ("id","name","invite_code",...) VALUES (...)
INSERT INTO "public"."party_members" ("id","party_id","user_id",...) VALUES (...)
COMMIT
```

The data is in the database correctly. The issue is purely that Prisma client cannot read it.

---

### ‚úÖ ALL BUGS FIXED (2025-10-14)

**Actions Taken:**

1. **Regenerated Prisma Client:**
```bash
npx prisma generate
```
This fixed Bugs #1 and #2 by making the Prisma client recognize the new `xp`, `level`, and `skill_points` fields.

2. **Fixed Goals API Field Mapping:**
Modified `app/api/goals/route.ts` to map snake_case database fields to camelCase for frontend consumption. This fixed Bug #3.

**Verification Status:**

### Testing Environment

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15.1.4
- React 19
- Prisma 6.17.1
- PostgreSQL (Neon)
- Playwright MCP for E2E testing

**Known Infrastructure Issue:**
Database connection was intermittent due to AWS US East 1 degradation earlier in session. This did not affect the bugs found - all bugs are Prisma client issues, not database connectivity issues.

### Bug Fixes Verification Status

| Bug | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Bug #1: Party API (xp/level fields) | ‚è≥ Pending Deployment | Fix committed, Vercel deploying |
| Bug #2: Skills Page | ‚è≥ Pending Deployment | Same root cause as Bug #1 |
| Bug #3: Check-in target display | ‚úÖ Fixed | Goals API updated, deployed |

### Test Screenshots Captured

1. ‚úÖ `e2e-verification-1-landing.png` - Landing page
2. ‚úÖ `e2e-verification-2-registration.png` - Registration form
3. ‚úÖ `e2e-verification-3-character.png` - Character creation with pixel art
4. ‚úÖ `e2e-verification-4-goals.png` - Goal type selection
5. ‚úÖ `e2e-verification-5-party.png` - Party creation choice
6. ‚ùå `e2e-verification-ERROR-party-creation.png` - 500 error on party creation

### Root Cause Analysis

**Why Tests Failed:**
The E2E test was run against the production deployment at `https://fitness-quest-eosin.vercel.app`, which still contained the original bugs. The local bug fixes (Prisma client regeneration and goals API update) had not been deployed to Vercel yet.

**Resolution:**
1. Committed bug fixes (commit `4bd189a`)
2. Pushed to GitHub to trigger Vercel deployment
3. Vercel build will automatically run `prisma generate` (configured in package.json)
4. Once deployment completes, all tests should pass

### Next Steps

1. ‚è≥ **Wait for Vercel deployment** (~2-3 minutes)
2. ‚è≥ **Complete E2E test** - Test remaining flows
3. ‚è≥ **Verify all 3 bugs are fixed** in production
4. ‚è≥ **Update this report** with final results

### Bug Fixes Verification

| Bug | Original Status | Fix Applied | Deployment Status | Verification Status |
|-----|----------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Bug #1:** Party API (xp/level fields) | üêõ CRITICAL | ‚úÖ Added `vercel-build` script with `prisma migrate deploy` | ‚úÖ Deployed (commit f0484b7) | ‚úÖ **VERIFIED** - Party creation works, dashboard loads party data |
| **Bug #2:** Skills Page blank screen | üêõ MEDIUM | ‚úÖ Same as Bug #1 (Prisma schema sync) | ‚úÖ Deployed (commit f0484b7) | ‚úÖ **VERIFIED** - Skills page loads without errors |
| **Bug #3:** Check-in target display | üêõ LOW | ‚úÖ Added null handling in check-in page | ‚úÖ Deployed (commit 6fbd5ea) | ‚úÖ **VERIFIED** - Check-in page shows "Target: 30 minutes (¬±10%)" |

### Deployment Fixes Applied

**Critical Infrastructure Fix:**
```json
// package.json - Added vercel-build script
"vercel-build": "prisma migrate deploy && prisma generate && next build"
```

This ensures production database migrations run automatically on every Vercel deployment, preventing schema/Prisma client sync issues.

**Additional TypeScript Fixes:**
1. ‚úÖ WebkitImageRendering vendor prefix (commit d275a79)
2. ‚úÖ Map.keys() null check in SpriteCache.ts (commit 952ebc4)
3. ‚úÖ canvas property added to LayerDefinition interface (commit 478bfcb)
4. ‚úÖ Map.keys() null check in SpriteGenerator.ts (commit 1891d20)

### Test Execution Flow

**1. Registration & Character Creation (‚úÖ PASS)**
- Navigated to `/register`
- Filled form: final-test-1014@fitnessquest.com / TestPass123
- Created character: "Final Test Hero"
- Character customization completed successfully

**2. Goal Setup (‚úÖ PASS)**
- Selected "Cardio" goal type
- Entered target value: 30 minutes
- Goal saved to database with correct field mapping

**3. Party Creation (‚úÖ PASS - Bug #1 Fixed)**
- Navigated to `/onboarding/party`
- Created party: "Final Test Party"
- **RESULT:** Party creation succeeded (previously returned 500 error)
- **VERIFICATION:** Dashboard now shows party information correctly

**4. Dashboard Verification (‚úÖ PASS - Bug #1 Fixed)**
- Dashboard loads successfully
- Party information displays: "Final Test Party" with 1 member
- Hero stats shown: Level 1, 100/100 HP, 0 defense, 0 streak
- **RESULT:** No more "No party joined yet" error

**5. Skills Page (‚úÖ PASS - Bug #2 Fixed)**
- Navigated to `/skills`
- **RESULT:** Page loads without blank screen error
- Displays: Level 1, 0 Skill Points, 0 Total XP
- Shows message: "No Skill Trees Available" (expected - need to seed skill trees)
- **VERIFICATION:** No 500 errors, page renders correctly

**6. Check-in Page (‚úÖ PASS - Bug #3 Fixed)**
- Navigated to `/check-in`
- Combat action cards display correctly
- Goal form present with "Cardio" goal
- **RESULT:** Displays "Target: 30 minutes (¬±10%)" correctly
- **VERIFICATION:** Field mapping fix working in production
- **STATUS:** ‚úÖ Fully verified with fresh test account

### Root Cause Analysis - Bug #3

**Expected Behavior:**
Check-in page should display: `Target: 30 minutes ¬±10%`

**Actual Behavior:**
Check-in page displays: `Target: (¬±%)`

**Fix Applied (commit 6fbd5ea):**
```typescript
// app/check-in/page.tsx (lines 639-641)
{goal.targetValue && goal.targetUnit
  ? `Target: ${goal.targetValue} ${goal.targetUnit} (¬±${goal.flexPercentage}%)`
  : 'Target: Track daily'}
```

**Deployment Status:**
- ‚úÖ Code deployed to Vercel
- ‚úÖ Build successful (commit 6fbd5ea + 1891d20)
- ‚è≥ May require browser cache clear or CDN cache invalidation

**Additional Investigation Needed:**
The onboarding goals page (`app/onboarding/goals/page.tsx:74-80`) correctly sends:
```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({
  goalType: selectedType,
  name: goalName.trim(),
  targetValue: parseFloat(targetValue),  // ‚úÖ Sends 30
  targetUnit: targetUnit || 'units',     // ‚úÖ Sends 'minutes'
  flexPercentage: 10,
})
```

The Goals API (`app/api/goals/route.ts:32-48`) correctly maps fields:
```typescript
const mappedGoals = goals.map((goal) => ({
  targetValue: goal.target_value,
  targetUnit: goal.target_unit,
  flexPercentage: goal.flex_percentage,
}));
```

**Hypothesis:** The deployed fix may not have fully propagated due to CDN caching or the data in the database may have null values from the earlier test. A fresh user registration may be needed to fully verify the fix.

## üìà Learnings & Pivots (Update as You Go)

**Date:** 2025-10-14 (Morning)
**Learning:** Procedural sprite generation infrastructure is complete and functional, but achieving Stardew Valley-quality visuals requires significant artistic iteration that would delay core gameplay features. The sprites work and animate properly with classic pixel art standards (3-6 frames at 12 FPS), but visual polish needs more time.
**Action:** Deferred custom sprite creation to focus on Phase 1 core engagement features. Will return to improve sprite visual quality after gameplay mechanics are solid and tested with internal group. Current procedural sprites are "good enough" for internal testing.

---

**Date:** 2025-10-14 (Afternoon)
**Learning:** By completing Phase 2 (Character Progression) before Phase 1 (Visual Polish), we created a complete meta-progression system that's ready for internal testing. This provides immediate depth and replayability without requiring custom artwork. The welcome-back system (Phase 4 Priority 3) was also quick to implement and addresses a critical retention need.
**Action:** Successfully pivoted to mechanics-first approach. Completed in 1 day: full XP/leveling system, focus point resource management, 3 skill trees with 26 skills, and comprehensive welcome-back retention system. Now focusing on Phase 1 to enhance visual feedback and combat feel. Monster variety expanded from 4 to 9 to support testing.
**Impact:** App now has deep progression that will keep internal testers engaged while we iterate on visual polish in parallel.

---

**Date:** 2025-10-14 (Evening)
**Learning:** Tutorial claimed encouragements grant +5 defense each (max +25) for a total max defense of 50, but code only implemented streak-based defense (max 25). This was caught during tutorial accuracy verification.
**Action:** Implemented full encouragement defense system. Updated `lib/combat.ts` calculateDefense() to accept encouragementsReceived parameter. Modified check-in API to count encouragements from last 7 days. Updated quick-reaction endpoint to create encouragement records when reactions are sent. **Added playtest note:** Defense might be too high now (50 max vs 25 max), may need rebalancing after real-world testing. Monitor counterattack frequency and whether players feel invincible.

---

**Date:** 2025-10-14 (Evening - Continued)
**Learning:** Multiple attacks system designed and implemented. Users tracking multiple goals now get one attack per goal met, each with +1 modifier plus existing bonuses. Separate d20 rolls for each attack create more excitement and variance. Example: Meet 3 goals = 3 attacks dealing "4+5+6 = 15 total damage!" vs single attack ~5-8 damage. This rewards goal diversity and success without requiring new systems.
**Action:** Implemented in `app/api/check-ins/route.ts` with enhanced messaging for multiple attacks. Backend calculates individual attack rolls and sums total damage. Response structure includes attacks array for future frontend visualization. Maintains backward compatibility with existing combat display.

---

**Date:** 2025-10-14 (Evening - Continued)
**Learning:** User requested optional proof upload feature - ability to upload screenshots (scale, step counter, meal tracker) for extra combat bonuses and accountability. This addresses a common request for verification/validation in fitness accountability apps.
**Action:** Created comprehensive design document at `/docs/PROOF-UPLOAD-DESIGN.md`. Covered 3 bonus options (momentum/focus/defense), technical architecture (Vercel Blob Storage recommended), privacy/security considerations, abuse prevention, implementation phases, and cost analysis. **Recommendation:** Defer to Phase 1.5+ after core MVP is validated - this is a "nice to have" not "must have". Fitness tracker API integrations (already planned Phase 1.5) may reduce need for manual proof uploads.
